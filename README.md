# Optimal Market Algorithm
Given a list of buy and sell orders in a trading system, optimal algorithm takes in orders, which matches as many buyers to sellers by
creating trades between party pairs. Each trade must be executed at the mid-market rate, which is defined as the quantity-weighted average of input prices within a given
product. 
Algorthm shows a good use case for bidirectional queue.
Algorthm is also adjusted to allow for limits, specifying how much net amount they are able to buy and sell.
